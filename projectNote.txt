Python Models:
-Models are a CLASS which represents a table in database.
-Eash type of data have (e.g. Users, Jobs) is represented by it's own model.
-Each model maps to a single table in database.

After Creating Model:
-after creating the model, we should update the database.
--manage.py makemigrations
--manage.py migrate

Interacting with data into the Database(ENV is ON):
-manage.py shell
>>> from appName.models import classInsideTheModel # classInsideTheModel also the name of the table inside the DB
>>> classInsideTheModel # this is to confirm we targetted the model
>>> classInsideTheModel.objects.all() # query available object inside the database
>>> objName = classInsideTheModel() # create new instance of that class 
>>> objName.title = "Putok, this is the title" # .title is a property of that classa and assigning a value to that property
>>> objName.title # returns the value inside that property
>>> objName.save() # saves this object instance to the DB
>>> classInsideTheModel.objects.all() # query available object inside the database
>>> classInsideTheModel.objects.all()[0] # query specific object into the DB
